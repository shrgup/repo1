Publish Button Gets Disabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a bug that has been hit but lots of users and is causing a bit of frustration and increased support cost.

[quote]
Mark, a reviewer, has been working on a code review and as he was adding a comment, he noticed that the publish comment is disabled.
After being confused about the reason, he decided to restart CodeFlow and after which he was able to publish comments agai.
Unfortonately, the issue kept reproducing for him which caused some frustration causing him to contact cfdevs.
CodeFlow developers suggested using Ctrl+Enter which will publish successfully even if publish button is disabled until they resolve the issue.

Dashboard Review and Project Updates are not reliable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dashboard doesn't use the proper model of authenticating at the front door, and then using a service account to get the job done with the core code review service.
This results in cases where authorization logic was stripped form the code to get scenarios working.
In addition, there are still scenarios that fail due to authorization logic that can't be removed.

Tim, a code review author, sometimes prefer to use the dashboard to do quick operations like ping, complete or recall code reviews without having to open the CodeFlow GUI client.
He has noticed that in some cases these operations do not succeed.

Data Loss

.Losing Description on Publish Errors
[quote]
Grant, a code review author, is in the process of publishing a code review.
He has selected the change list, the reviewers, the work items, and wrote a length and descriptive comment.
He then clicked Publish which failed due to some network flakiness of backend service issue, causing CodeFlow to report an error and quit.
Grant was frustrated that he lost the time he spent on writing the description and sent an email to cfdevs requesting that CodeFlow be resillient to such failures.
Even if the error persists after several retries, CodeFlow should provide a way for developers to not lose their data.

.Losing comments on network errors
[quote]
Francisco, a code reviewer, was working on adding a lengthy comment and as he clicked published, CodeFlow reported an error due to inability to connect to service and shutdown.
He was frustrated due to loss of his comment(s) and emailed cfdevs requested higher reliability.

.File marks are lost
[quote]
Greg, a code reviewer, likes tracking what files he has completed reviewing using the mark file feature.
As he was half the way through the review, he switch to a previous iteration to check some initial version of a function.
He was surprised to find out that he has completely lost his file marking.
He sent an email to cfdevs requesting that marking be persisted when switching iterations as well as cross CodeFlow runs.

.Lost unpulished comments
[quote]
Peter, a code reviewer, likes adding his comments and keeping them unpublished when he is not sure about his comments yet.
As he forms a stronger opinion based on the code reviewed, he publishes the comments within the file or in other files.
He has lost comments in multiple scenarios due to a CodeFlow crash or due to him existing CodeFlow without publishing all the comments.
He emailed cfdevs to explain his frustration, but cfdevs told him that this is not a recommended scenario and that he should publish comments right away and re-call them if needed.
However, they have acknowledged, that CodeFlow shouldn't lose comments on crash and should prompt the user with a warning if they have unpublished comments.

.Won't Fix hides even unpublished comments
[quote]
Amanda, a code review author, decided not to fix one of the comments she got from one of her reviewers.
She wrote the reply and then selected "won't fix", which resulted in the comment collapsing.
Due to it being collapsed, Amanada assume that the reply was publish, but she later figured out that only the status change was published.
She expected that the comment shouldn't be collapsed until the new added reply is published.
